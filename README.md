# notado-cli

A CLI to search through your notes and backup your [Notado](https://notado.app) library

## Installation

This tool can be compiled using `cargo install`:

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/LGUG2Z/notado-cli
```

## Usage

### Credentials

In order to retrieve information from your personal account, make sure that you have set the `NOTADO_API_TOKEN`
environment variable to the API token shown on [https://notado.app/settings](https://notado.app/settings) before using
this tool.

### Backup

The `backup` command prints all notes in your account to stdout. You can redirect this output to a file and use
scheduled tasks to automatically export snapshots of your library.

```bash
notado-cli backup >"notado-backup-$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%d-%H').json"
```

### Search

The `search` command prints same results as the fuzzy search bar on
your [main feed page](https://notado.app) to stdout.

```jsonc
// ‚ùØ notado-cli search "empathy"

You can find purpose in fork polishing through both excellence and empathy for your customers.

of an advanced society. They never forced their animal brain to evolve past its first instinct. They never forged new mental pathways to overcome their own instinctual fears. And so, their thinking and problem-solving will lack the imagination and creativity that the kindest people have in spades.",
